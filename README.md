# 03-Javascript: Word Guess Game

This website consists of a barebones .html file, a CSS reset and style file, and the primary JavaScript file written to run a Word Guess Game. The words in this guess game are themed around the popular video game franchise, "Halo". 

Despite spending somewhere between 16-20 hours on this assignment, I was not able to produce a functional product. Code blocks have otherwise been filled out to represent the expected code solution. Missing code blocks have been commented with pseudocode to demonstrate the intent of the program.
